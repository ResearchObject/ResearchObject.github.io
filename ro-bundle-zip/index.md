The [RO Bundle](https://w3id.org/bundle) specification defines a file format for storage and distribution of Research Objects as a ZIP archive; called a **Research Object Bundle** (RO Bundle). RO Bundles allow capturing a Research Object to a single file or byte-stream by including its manifest, annotations and some or all of its aggregated resources for the purposes of exporting, archiving, publishing and transferring research objects.
The following libraries are available for managing Research Object Bundles:



	
  * Java: [taverna-robundle](https://github.com/apache/incubator-taverna-language/tree/master/taverna-robundle)

	
  * Ruby: [ruby-ro-bundle](https://github.com/myGrid/ruby-ro-bundle)

        
  * Python: [ro-python](https://github.com/researchobject/ro-python)


Research Object bundles can also be created with the command line tool that is part of [ro-python](https://github.com/researchobject/ro-python).
