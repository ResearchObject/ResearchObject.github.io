## Introduction




Scholarly Communication has evolved significantly in recent years, with an increasing focus on **Open Research**, [FAIR](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) data sharing and community-developed open source methods. The concepts of _authorship_ and _citation_ are changing, as researchers are increasingly reusing and evolving common software tools and datasets. Yet with a growing amount of cloud compute power and open platforms available, **reproducibility** of computational analyses becomes more challenging, and not yet commonly included in peer review. While recent advances in scientific **workflows** and **provenance** capture systems have improved on this situation, a question remains on how to_ publish, archive, explore _and_ understand_ digital research outputs, as academic authors and publishers remain focused on PDFs and the occasional CSV file, with the Web and Open Research often left to “best effort” rather than being the expected norm.


A number of community initiatives have begun to explore how to package various multi-part research outcomes with their context, how to handle distributed and living content and how to port and safely exchange these “Research Objects” between platform and between researchers.


One such approach is[ researchobject.org](http://researchobject.org) which has proposed a way to package and describe research outputs, data, methods, workflows, provenance and structured metadata, reusing existing Web standards and formats.




Research Objects, and Research Object-like approaches have gathered pace across:





	
  * Scientific domains - bioinformatics, systems biology (e.g. [COMBINE Archives](http://co.mbine.org/documents/archive)), health informatics (e.g. [BioComputeObject](https://osf.io/h59uh/));

	
  * Tasks - handling big data ([BDBags](http://bd2k.ini.usc.edu/tools/bdbag/)), reproducible workflows ([Common Workflow Language](http://www.commonwl.org/)), scholarly communication and publishing ([Dryad](https://datadryad.org/), [DataONE](https://www.dataone.org/));

	
  * Platforms:

	
    * Virtual Research Environments, e.g. the [EVER-EST](http://ever-est.eu/) VRE for Earth Sciences;

	
    * Community output aggregators such as the EU’s [OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/), [FAIRDOMHub](https://fairdomhub.org/), [CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/) and [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/).

	
    * Publishers - such as eLife’s [Reproducible Document Stack](https://elifesciences.org/labs/7dbeb390/reproducible-document-stack-supporting-the-next-generation-research-article) project and [science.ai](https://science.ai/)

	
    * Repository providers such a [dataONE](https://www.dataone.org/) and [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/)

	
    * Funders, including EU (e.g. [European Open Science Cloud](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/european-open-science-cloud)) and NIH (e.g. [Data Commons](https://commonfund.nih.gov/bd2k/commons))







However, many challenges remain as to how to increase Research Object uptake with data providers, researchers, infrastructures, publishers and other stakeholders; credit and tracking metrics; develop supporting tooling; building effective community efforts and the relationship of rich metadata manifests with emerging container platforms.


At RO2018 we explored recent advancements in Research Objects and publishing of research data.


## Topics




The workshop was a mix of presentation sessions and “unconferencing” sessions including:





	
  * Keynotes and invited talks

## Submitted contributions


RO2018 welcomed submissions in a variety of forms covering the above topics: **Short articles** for more developed research, software or data contributions, **Abstracts** for oral communication and **Poster and demo abstracts**.
For further details, see the [Guide for submitting to RO2018](http://www.researchobject.org/ro2018/submitting-to-ro2018/) and [accepted contributions](/ro2018/ro2018-proceedings/).
Workshop participants were encouraged to separately [propose](https://goo.gl/C1ubw9 ) _lighting talks_, _breakout_ sessions and ideas for _discussion_ points for the _unconference_ session of the workshop.
RO2018 encouraged **open peer review**, and recommended that reviewers are named and attributed; however reviewers could be anonymous if so desired. Peer reviews will be published on Zenodo.
For any questions, email the RO2018 Workshop Organizers at [ro2018@easychair.org](mailto:ro2018@easychair.org)


## Proposals for Breakout Sessions




The workshop was an opportunity to run breakout sessions. We encouraged breakout proposals and discussion ideas to be added in this [shared document](https://goo.gl/C1ubw9). The




## Lightning talks, posters and demo




RO2018 welcomed short **lightning talks** (1 slide, ~5 minutes), to introduce a single topic, e.g. an ongoing activity, research idea, collaboration opportunity, software or method.




Suggestions for a lightning talk was added at any point to the [shared document](https://goo.gl/C1ubw9). Attendees did not need to be an invited presenter to propose a lightning talk, but the lightning talks are not part of the conference proceeding.




An informal demo and poster session will take place during the afternoon. Accepted poster and demo presenters should also give a lightning talk to introduce their work.
