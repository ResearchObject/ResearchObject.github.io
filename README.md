# Research Object website researchobject.org

This is the GitHub repository for contributing to the [Research Object](http://www.researchobject.org/) website.

The `*.md` files use [MarkDown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown) content that is rendered to <https://researchobject.github.io/> by [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). Alias <http://researchobject.org/> will (eventually) map to the same URL space.

Posts in `_posts/` must have a filename like `2019-12-24-.md` and will appear on the bottom of the front page in reverse chronological order.

To add to the top menu, edit `_config.yml`

Note that some subfolders are maintained in [other ResearchObject respositories](https://github.com/ResearchObject):

* [/specifications](https://github.com/ResearchObject/specifications)
* [/ro2019](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro2019)
* [/ro-crate](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate)
