If you use the statistical computation language [R](https://www.r-project.org/), you can find several [CRAN packages for reproducible research](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html), including [knitr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html), [rmarkdown](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmarkdown/index.html) and [packrat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/packrat/index.html).


[R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) also have many features to aid reproducibility.


For more details, see the blog article [Reproducible research, training wheels, and knitr](http://www.r-bloggers.com/reproducible-research-training-wheels-and-knitr/).
