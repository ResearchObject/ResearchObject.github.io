VIVO is an open source application implementing semantic web principles and technologies to represent academic research communities. When populated with researcher interests, activities, and accomplishments, VIVO enables the discovery of research and scholarship across disciplines at one institution or across many.
The [Integrated Semantic Framework](http://ctsaconnect.org/) ontology modules for VIVO (the VIVO-ISF ontology) provide a set of types (classes) and relationships (properties) to represent researchers and the full context in which they work. Content in any local VIVO installation may be maintained manually, brought into VIVO in automated ways from local systems of record, such as HR, grants, course, and faculty activity databases, or from database providers such as publication aggregators and funding agencies.
