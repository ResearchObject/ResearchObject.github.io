Wf4Ever member Daniel Garijo of UPM published an article, titled "Quantifying Reproducibility in Computational Biology: The Case of the Tuberculosis Drugome" in the world-leading Computational Biology journal PLOS ONE, with researchers from 5 other institutions. The article quantifies the cost of reproducing computational research in computational biology by using an exemplar experiment from one of the co-author's own research group. The article provides useful insights and guidelines for improving reproducibility.
