A Data Package (or DataPackage) is a simple way of "packaging" up data.
To create a Data Package, all you need to do is place a "descriptor" file named `datapackage.json` in the top-level directory of your set of data files.


#### Why Data Packages? How Can They Help?


Imagine a situation such as the following:



	
  * You have a set of data files in a directory (and subdirectories) - whether locally or online

	
  * You want to provide basic info for this collection (the "dataset") - perhaps you want to publish this data for others, or simply to manage it better yourself

	
  * Information like: author, license, list of files in the dataset (and possibly info on those files, like a schema)


The Data Package approach provides a **very simple**, **web friendly**, **standardized** and **extensible**, way for you to do this.
