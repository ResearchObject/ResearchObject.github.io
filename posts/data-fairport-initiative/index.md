Data FAIRport is an open initiative of representatives from the worlds of research infrastructure and policy, publishing, the semantic web and life sciences research. Data FAIRport was founded in January of 2014. It’s vision is to realise and enable a situation where valuable scientific data is ‘FAIR’ in the sense of being Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable.
