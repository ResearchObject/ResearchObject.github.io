[FAIR](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) is a mantra; a meme; a myth; a mystery; a moan. For the past 15 years I have been working on FAIR in a bunch of projects and initiatives in Life Science projects. Some are top-down like Life Science European _Research Infrastructures_ [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org/) and [ISBE](http://isbe.org.uk/), and some are bottom-up, supporting research projects in _Systems and Synthetic Biology_ ([FAIRDOM](https://fair-dom.org/)), _Biodiversity_ ([BioVel](https://www.biovel.eu/)), and _Pharmacology_ ([Open PHACTS](https://www.openphacts.org/)), for example. Some have become _movements_, like [Bioschemas](http://bioschemas.org/), the [Common Workflow Language](Common Workflow Language) and [Research Objects](http://www.researchobject.org/). Others focus on cross-cutting approaches in _reproducibility_, computational _workflows_, _metadata_ representation and scholarly _sharing_ & _publication_. In this talk I will relate a series of **FAIRy tales**. Some of them are Grimm. Some have happy endings. Who are the villains and who are the heroes? What are the morals we can draw from these stories?</blockquote>
