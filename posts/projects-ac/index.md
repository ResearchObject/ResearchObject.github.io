Projects.ac is a commercial application developed and released by [digital science](http://www.digital-science.com). The goal of the application is to support the academic researcher in managing collections of content that relate to projects or studies.
A key feature of projects is a **timeline **that displays a trace of the provenance for a project as a series of chronological events.
