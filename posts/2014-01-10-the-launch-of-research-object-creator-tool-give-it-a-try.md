[ Research Object Creator Tool](http://linkingresearch.wordpress.com/2014/01/10/rohub-linkeddata-es/) is a very lightweight RO creation tool built by Daniel Garijo of UPM. The tool takes as input a LaTeX file and extracts its title and abstract to create an annotated page in RDF-a. It also produces a structure of the contents to reference, so users only have to fill in (and annotate if you want) the resources to point to. A sample can be seen in the image to the left and more details can be found in [Daniel's blog page](http://linkingresearch.wordpress.com/2014/01/10/rohub-linkeddata-es/).
