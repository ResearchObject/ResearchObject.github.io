The Digital Object Architecture provides a mechanism for the creation of, and access to, digital objects as discrete data structures with unique, resolvable identifiers. These Digital Objects provide a foundation for representing and interacting with information on the Internet.
From CNRI's Press Release:


<blockquote>With the software suite, organizations can provide an interoperable interface to individually identified units of information structured as digital objects that exist independently of the storage system, service provider, proprietary technology or protocol. By providing a formal interface through which objects can be securely and reliably accessed, stored and replicated, the system provides a distributed platform for maintaining and preserving digital information."
"The DO Repository software provides multiple network interfaces for performing operations on digital objects: the Digital Object Protocol (DOP), HTTP, and DOP-over-TLS (Transport Layer Security, aka SSL). The various interfaces each have their own benefits in terms of security, compatibility with proxy servers, and use of ubiquitous client software. Redundancy is built into DOP, along with strong individual and group authentication. Redundancy is supported by a mirroring system in which each DO Repository communicates with others to ensure that replicated objects are kept in sync. Authentication is based on either secret or public/private keys and X.509 certificates."</blockquote>
