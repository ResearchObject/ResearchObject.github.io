# Research Object Crate


[RO-Crate](https://researchobject.github.io/ro-crate/) is being developed as a schema.org-style [lightweight alternative](https://researchobject.github.io/ro-lite/background.html) to existing Research Object serializations.
Join the [community](https://researchobject.github.io/ro-crate/#contribute) to help shape the specification!


# Workshop on Research Objects (RO2019)


We are proud to announce that the [RO2019 workshop](https://researchobject.github.io/ro2019/) will take part at the [IEEE eScience Conference 2019](https://escience2019.sdsc.edu/) on 24 Sept 2019 in San Diego, US. This follows last year's successful [RO2018](http://www.researchobject.org/ro2018/),























**Researchobject.org** aims to map the landscape of initiatives and activity in the development of **Research Objects**, an emerging approach to the publication, and exchange of scholarly information on the Web.Research Objects aim to improve reuse and reproducibility by:



	
  * Supporting the publication of **more than just PDFs**, making **data**, **code**, and other resources **first class citizens of scholarship**

	
  * Recognizing that there is often a need to publish collections of these resources together as one **shareable**, **cite-able** resource.

	
  * **Enriching** these resources and collections with any and all additional information required to make research **reusable**, and **reproducible**!


Research objects are not just data, not just collections, but any digital resource that aims to go beyond the PDF for scholarly publishing!


























## Going beyond the PDF

The reuse and reproduction of scientific experiments as they are described in publications can be hard. Often it requires additional information, data, tooling or support beyond that provided in the text of a traditional publication.
As part of one research investigation you might for example have:



	
  * Slides hosted on slideshare,

	
  * Code in a github repository,

	
  * Data in figshare,

	
  * Data in ArrayExpress.


A growing number of activities are developing new mechanisms, or repurposing existing mechanisms in order to describe and associate resources like this together, in a machine-readable manner, so that they can be more easily shared, and exchanged.
The goal of research objects is to improve the potential for understanding and reuse of research by making sure that the information that is needed to make a published resource useful is associated with it, and shared as a whole.























## How?







![aggregation](/pages/wp-content/images/coreonion.png)


There are a growing number of, individuals, groups, and [initiatives](http://www.researchobject.org/initiative/) - all trying to improve the state of scholarly publication. These range from domain specific to general, and from the practical and immediately actionable, to the more visionary and experimental.
What is emerging from these activities is a common set of **goals** and **principles** - features that are required required to support research that is **Findable**, **Accessible**, **Interoperable**, and **Reusable** (FAIR).
To understand more about the **principles**, **goals** of the Research Object approach, head over to the [Overview](http://www.researchobject.org/overview/) page.
