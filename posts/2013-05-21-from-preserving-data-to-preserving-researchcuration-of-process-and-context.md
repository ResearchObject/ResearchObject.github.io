The TIMBUS and Wf4Ever projects are offering a half-day tutorial at the International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries (TPDL) 2013, in Valletta, Malta on September 22, 2013. [http://tpdl2013.upatras.gr/tut-pdpr.php](http://tpdl2013.upatras.gr/tut-pdpr.php)
**ABSTRACT**
In the domain of eScience, investigations are increasingly collaborative. Most scientific and engineering domains benefit from building on the outputs of other research: by sharing information to reason over and data to incorporate in the modeling task at hand. This raises the need for preserving and sharing entire eScience workflows and processes for later reuse. We need to define which information is to be collected, create means to preserve it and approaches to enable and validate the re-execution of a preserved process. This includes and goes beyond preserving the data used in the experiments, as the process underlying its creation and use is essential.
The TIMBUS project and Wf4Ever project team up for this half-day tutorial to provide an introduction to the problem domain and discuss solutions for the curation of eScience processes.


### **TUTORIAL LEVEL**


Introductory level


### **DURATION**


Half-day


### **OUTLINE OF THE CONTENT **


The tutorial will cover the following topics:
**Introduction to Process and Context Preservation**: The introduction will motivate the need for process and context preservation, illustrate how this task is difficult in an evolving domain, and introduce a use case for the rest of the tutorial to illustrate approaches and tools.
**Data Citation**: Data forms the basis of the results of many research publications, and thus needs to be referenced with the same accuracy as bibliographic data. Only if data can be identified with high precision can it be reused, validated, verified and reproduced. Citing a specific data set is however not trivial - it exists in a vast plurality of specifications and instances, can potentially be huge in size, and its location might change. We will provide an overview over existing approaches to overcoming these challenges. Further, we will present the issue of creating data citations of data held in databases, especially of dynamic data sets where data is added or updated on a regular basis.
**Re-usability and traceability of workflows and processes**: The processes creating and interpreting data are complex objects. Curating and preserving them requires special effort, as they are dynamic, and highly dependent on software, configuration, hardware, and other aspects. We will discuss these issues in detail, and provide an introduction to two complementary approaches.
The first approach is based on the concept of Research Objects, which adopts a workflow-centric approach and thereby aims at facilitating the reuse and reproducibility. It allows packaging the data and the methods as one Research Object to share and cite it, and thus enable publishers to grant access to the actual data and methods that contribute to the findings reported in scholarly articles.
A second approach focuses on describing and preserving a process and the context it is embedded in. The artifacts that may need to be captured range from data, software and accompanying documentation, to legal and human resource aspects. Some of this information can be automatically extracted from an existing process, and tools for this will be presented. Ways to archive the process and to perform preservation actions on the process environment, such as recreating a controlled execution environment or migration of software components, are presented. Finally, the challenge of evaluating the re-execution of a preserved process is discussed, addressing means of establishing its authenticity.


### **INTENDED AUDIENCE **


The tutorial is targeted at researchers, publishers and curators in eScience disciplines who want to learn about methods of ensuring the long-term availability of experiments forming the basis of scientific research.


### **EXPECTED LEARNING OUTCOMES **


The tutorial participants will understand
