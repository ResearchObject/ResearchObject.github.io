Nano publications provides a model and vocabulary for describing a scientific statement - along with the context for that statement - in a machine readable manner.

From nanopub.org:


<blockquote>A publication is the smallest unit of publishable information: an assertion about anything that can be uniquely identified and attributed to its author.
Individual nanopublications can be cited by others and tracked for their impact on the community.
Nanopublications are a natural response to the explosion of high-quality contextual information that overwhelms the capacity of conventional research articles in scholarly communication.
With nanopublications, it is possible to disseminate individual data as independent publications with or without an accompanying research article. Furthermore, because nanopublications can be attributed and cited, they provide incentives for researchers to make their data available in standard formats that drive data accessibility and interoperability.</blockquote>
