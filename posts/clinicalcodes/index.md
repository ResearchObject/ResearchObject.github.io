The clinicalcodes.org repository holds code lists for published electronic medical record studies (i.e. the coded descriptions of study cohorts).
The goal of clinicalcodes.org is support replication of previously published studies. Using the Research Object model, an export of a study packages codes, study, and metadata together to support exchange.
An Example RO exported in this manner is on figshare: [http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1031591](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1031591)
