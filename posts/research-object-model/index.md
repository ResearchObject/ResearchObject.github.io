### RO Model Core


The core concepts of research objects, identity, aggregation, and annotation, are captured in the specification of the ro model. The specification of this core research object model is described in the ro ontology under the namespace [http://purl.org/wf4ever/ro#](http://purl.org/wf4ever/ro#).





### Extensions


There are also the following ontology implementations of extensions to the core research object model:



	
  * The [_roevo_](http://purl.org/wf4ever/roevo#) model describing the evolution of a Research Object and its aggregated resources, which is also based on the [W3C PROV Ontology](http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#) recommendation



	
  * The [_wfprov_](http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfprov#) provenance model describing the execution of a scientific workflow, which is based on the latest [W3C PROV Ontology](http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#) recommendation.

	
  * The [_wfdesc_](http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfdesc#) model describing scientific workflow protocols, see below, to facilitate interpretation and reuse of scientific workflow
