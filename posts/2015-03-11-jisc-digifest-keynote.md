[Carole Goble](https://twitter.com/CaroleAnneGoble) gave a thought provoking keynote presentation at the JISC [Digital Festival](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/events/jisc-digital-festival-2015-09-mar-2015) where she talked about [www.researchobject.org](http://www.researchobject.org/). It was great to see that the TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimensions in Scholarship) analogy was picked up by [Chris Parr](https://twitter.com/ChrisParrTHE) from [Times Higher Education](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/). You can find the talk live on the JISC website [here](http://mediasite.jisc.ac.uk/Mediasite/Play/8921d1d4499f4f47b8da76207e3d83dc1d).
