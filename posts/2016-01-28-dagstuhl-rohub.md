[ROHub](http://www.rohub.org/) ([https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-12024-9_9](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-12024-9_9)) is a digital library system supporting the storage, lifecycle management, sharing and preservation of research findings via Research Objects. It includes different features to help scientists throughout the research lifecycle: 

> 
> 
	
>   1. to create and maintain ROs that are compliant with predefined quality requirements so that they can be interpreted and reproduced in the future
> 
	
>   2. to collaborate along this process
> 
	
>   3. to publish and search these objects and their associated metadata
> 
	
>   4. to manage their evolution
> 
	
>   5. to monitor and preserve them through time ensuring that they will remain accessible and reusable
> 

ROHub has a modular structure, comprising a backend (rodl) that exposes a set of RESTful APIs and a SPARQL endpoint; and a frontend Web Portal providing a graphical interface for end users (scientists/researchers/etc.)
