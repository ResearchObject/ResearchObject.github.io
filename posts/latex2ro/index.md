[Latex2RO](https://github.com/dgarijo/Latex2RO) is a simple tool designed to help creating Research Objects (ROs) from LaTeX papers. Given a LaTeX file, the RO creator will extract its title and metadata and fill partially a structured HTML page annotated in RDF-a with these metadata, using the Research Object Model.
Examples of the HTML output can be seen at [http://rohub.linkeddata.es/](http://rohub.linkeddata.es/)
