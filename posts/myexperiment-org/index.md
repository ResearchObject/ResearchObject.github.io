[myExperiment](http://www.myexperiment.org) provides an early example of the use of Research Objects through the use of "packs".
myExperiment packs are represented using OAI-ORE and available as linked data and hence semantically-described for ease of discovery and reuse. They typically contain computational workflows, although this is not essential – the bundles are useful anyway, and this is demonstrated by the uptake of the OAI- ORE representation in very many projects. myExperiment’s particular notion of workflow-centric Research Objects has been much more fully developed in the [Wf4Ever project](http://www.wf4ever-project.org/).
