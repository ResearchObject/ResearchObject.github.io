Following our very successful workshop on "[What Bioinformaticians need to know about digital publishing beyond the PDF](http://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2013/workshops.php)" last year in ISMB 2013 ([see our blog post](http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/gigablog/2013/08/09/more-on-our-ismb-workshop-what-bioinformaticians-need-to-know-about-digital-publishing-beyond-the-pdf/)), we are thrilled to announce that our workshop series will be continued in [ISMB2014, Boston, USA](http://www.iscb.org/ismb2014) (tentative dates July 13, 14 or 15). This year, we will join force with BioMed Central, to expand our discussion on new ways of digital publishing by a new topic, i.e., new ways of peer review and their impact on bioinformatics. The workshop is organized by the managing board of [Research Object](http://researchobject.org), representatives of [ISA community](http://isa-tools.org/), and participation of BioMed Central and their journals Biology Direct and [GigaScience](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/). The workshop web site will be announced shortly! Mark your date, and join us in Boston!
